                <p><strong>my internet manifesto.</strong></p>
                <br>
                <p>I honestly hate how social media has become SO toxic. The internet has just become a cesspool of controversy, Quoting Sadgrl... "It's like having access to 1,000,000x the Library of Alexandria every day, and only being interested in keeping up with what people are talking about in the lobby."</p>
                <br>
                <p>I was born in the first generation that grew up with Facebook. It was a cool novelty at first... I miss playing Stick Run and Farmville but i've stepped away from mainstream social media after so much FUCKING harassment.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I admire the "webmaster" culture and honestly... I want it back. True decentralization. Not that virgin ass NFT crypto shit. I mean TRUE decentralization, making cool shit for the heck of it!</p>

                <br>
                <p>The internet was made to share ideas and thoughts so that the best ones could come to the top, but things went wrong. Instead of the best ideas, the loudest ones get attention, and big companies used tricks to make money off ads and data. Social media ignores bad behavior because it makes people stay online. It's a mess of the worst parts of the human condition.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So, the internet failed because people shared their stuff for free, and companies got greedy, eating up all our content. When that wasn't enough, they took our data and sold it for lots of money to advertisers. It's not good, and we're to blame for it.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p><strong>my vision</strong></p>
                <p>we should be able to make cool shit and connect with our fellow human. no hate, no algorithm, no paywalls, none of the dick measuring! We shouldn't have to deal with the shit Web3 has caused. No more consumerism, more creationism!</p>
