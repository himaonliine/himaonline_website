                <p><strong>back to school motherfu-</strong></p>
                <p>Well, it's back to school today and UGHHHHHH i do not wanna do this today... I wish it was a vacation, but thus is the life of the student.</p>

                <p>I went to school early thinking there was a flag ceremony, but guess what! NO FUCKING FLAG CEREMONY! I read the announcement wrong, and i guess that's my fault, but still, kinda pissed about it.</p>
                <img class="reaction" src="https://media.tenor.com/KXE2S4-PlnUAAAAi/anime-baka.gif">
                <p>Also, KanYe really just 180'd on his bullshit because... i shit you not, JONAH HILL IN 21 JUMP STREET! He really heard the "my name jeff" line and said "I get it now..."</p>
                <img class="reaction" src="https://media.tenor.com/3wtr1MRT_I8AAAAd/i-get-it-omg.gif">
                <p>Anyway, shit happens, amirite?</p>
                <p>Speaking of shit, My classmates. TIL that one of my classmates was taller than me and still YOUNGER??????? How the fuck does that work?</p>
                <p>My classmates are wildin. One of them is trying to "keep order" (aka: just fucking around with ppl). I feel bad for the presenters... Also GOD DAMN my classmates are ruthless on the teasing. They really wont get over my Parody Twitter phase. I literally QUIT twitter, so that's something.</p>
                <img class="reaction" src="https://media.tenor.com/Z0keca1HovEAAAAM/chunibyo-anime.gif">
                <p>Anyway, Homeroom class. The topic is "Sound Decision Making"... Something i have expertise in NOT doing wwwwww. Like, i make decisions haphazardly like the ADHD Autism gremlin i am. I make decisions but i don't really THINK about making them. I just.. do it. Like Nike. (I know that was corny but shut up)</p>
                <p>Another tangent, why does my laptop battery drain SO fast???? I'm on Power Saving Mode and it's already at 65% from a full charge! I've been using it for an HOUR! What the actual fuck is wrong with this thing.</p>
                <img class="reaction" src="https://media.tenor.com/xA4q0AO9UH0AAAAC/keyboard-hanamaru-kindergarten.gif">
                <p>Also, it's national ID signups today? I already signed up a while back so, meh. I don't really care. What i do care about is how my data is gonna run out because i thought my classmate had the goods and i was ready to pay! Also, i'm talking about baked goods here, not crystal meth, Mr. Gus Fring.</p>
                <p>I guess i'll try loading up my shit later at lunch time.</p>
                <p>Well, that's my morning report, i'll type up a storm later. Bye for now.</p>
