                <p><strong> A big web announcement.</strong></p>
                <p>I FINALLY GOT A NEW CUSTOM DOMAIN!!!! I am now on <a href="https://himaonline.moe">himaonline.moe</a> and i'll be setting up a mailserver too! Which is what i wouldve said if the power didnt cut out. Yeah the electricity in my house kinda went... out. Kinda hard to code a website during a mental health school break while also having no WiFi and basically no internet too.</p>
                <p>At least i actually got the hosting redirected and set up on Firebase's end before the power died. Speaking of which, power died due to some kind of maintenance ongoing with the wires. Meralco (my electricity provider) is probably to blame. They're probably still gonna charge us for this too.</p>
                <p>I also took a break from school today since i kinda.. did a "Low Tier God" in school and attempted to CTB.... Yeah. I'm trying to phrase this as lightly as possible but this is the best i could do. I'm still fine though, Don't worry.</p>
