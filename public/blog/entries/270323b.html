                <p><strong>The trials and tribulations of a science class student.</strong></p>
                <p>Well, i'm working on my thesis and GOD DAMMIT my team mate is absent so now i have to actually do shit. Wild. Also, there was a science test today. I did.... alright at best.</p>

                <p>AP class was... definitely an experience. The teacher deadass just made us sing a nursery rhyme before class. I'm in 10th grade. Am i high? Probably. I guess the paragos really did have wooden wheels that creaked. I can't make this shit up.</p>
                <p>There was also reporting, where me and my team had to present a project to promote gender equality.</p>

                <p>Filipino and Journalism class wasn't much to talk about, Nothing of note happened. I also ran out of data so i didn't have internet for half the day. It's a wonder i managed to actually make this part 2 out of the local copy i had on my laptop.</p>
                <p>It was a constant battle between managing my code, watching my battery drain, having to charge my laptop and barter for data. It was.... very difficult to say the least. And my school isn't even air-conditioned! It wreaked havoc on my thermals!</p>
                <p>I also had that loli ice cream song stuck in my head while reading and read "Nelson Mandela: Hero Of Africa" to the tune of "aisu kuriimu, kita no kuni karaaa" in my head. It was... painful.</p>
